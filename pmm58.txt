 However, there is an additional requirement that each of you submit a brief written statement summarizing your 
 experience working on the assignment and what you learned. Upload these two files as netid.txt along with your submission. 
 This way it's still somewhat anonymous, but we can distinguish between them.

 I had a good experience working on this assignment. I slowly learned how to use git (thanks a lot to my partner's patience). There was a lot of struggly with it at first, namely the add, commit, 
 push and pull and how those work but we got there. I then learned about choosing which pattern should be used where thanks to the ULAs as we designed the code's prospective UML. I then learned about
 Mementos, Commands, Factory and strategy patterns as we implemented them and wrote them up for the report. I also learned about how patterns and encapsulation allow for other functions of the code 
 to be more easily implemented as it is clear what each segment does, how to use it, and making changes elsewhere usually won't cause a problem to other unexpected parts of the code. I also learned
 that refactoring guru is an incredible website.
