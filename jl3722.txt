This assignment taught me how to implement design patterns into my decision making process for the design of code. For instance, my partner Peter and I started by creating the UML diagram to make sure that we were implementing at least 4 design patterns. While I would typically implement a basic/rough draft of the required classes before drawing the UML, I saw that shifting to a design pattern-focused mindset allowed me to better conceptualize the relationships between classes and allowed us to maintain encapsulation and abstraction of concrete classes such as HumanPlayer and Tile from relatively non-related classes as well as the client. Of course, I learned how to implement key OOP design patterns and in particular, got ample practice with implementing the Command and Strategy patterns. In addition, this assignment helped me practice collaborating with team members using Git. For instance, we initially struggled with merging our conflicting code changes, but I learned how to take advantage of the Git stash and stash pop commands to save my local changes and how to use the merge options (rebase versus ff / fast-forward) to keep the correct changes upon merging from origin/main.
